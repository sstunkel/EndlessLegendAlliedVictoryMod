To do so they recruit, train, and arm lesser beings from the tribes and vagrants that live scattered across the surface of Auriga. Regardless of where they are to to whom they have previously sworn allegiance, when a tribe turns to the Cult it does so until its death.

  <LocalizationPair Name="%UnitProfileRageWizardsHero1Title">Zarcha Attinul</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%UnitProfileRageWizardsHero1Description">Attinul showed great promise even before starting formal training. It was this natural skill that helped her to survive when lost in the Dune Ridges, a situation caused by a coming of age expedition that was attacked by Sand Jotus. She crawled out of the desert days later, a dried and desiccated husk kept alive only by the intensity of her will. Rapid ascension through the rigors of the East Sandsea Hall academies was followed by a departure for other lands; Attinul remains obsessed by the development of her own powers and the destruction of Jotus.
Unusual for an Ardent Mage she has learned skills of hunting and tracking in order to find her prey. Attinul is therefore capable in a number of roles not traditionally attributed to students from the Wizards' academies, such as scouting, infiltration, and butchering game.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%UnitProfileRageWizardsHero2Title">High Inquistor Asalah Arca </LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%UnitProfileRageWizardsHero2Description">Born to the Felkani clan, who inhabit some of Auriga's most inhospitable desert climes, young Asalah quickly grew accustomed to the hardships of Ardent Mage life. With a merciless sun beating down from overhead, and only stunted brush and skinny livestock for company, even the banal task of scratching a day-to-day living inflicted a degree of pain upon the clansmen. Among the young especially, the temptation to alleviate this discomfort was immense. Not for Asalah, however. When she discovered one day that a friend had stolen a plate of flatbreads, rather than seek to share in the pickings she whipped up a frenzy of indignation among her peers, and, with the help of a whipping branch, chastised the perpetrator. In time, Asalah's iron discipline and unflinching honesty saw her rise far in the ranks of the Ardent Mage army, but her ability to unearth the truth from even the most defiant subject did not go unnoticed. Inevitably, she was inducted into the Ardent Inquisition. Nowadays, sickened by the creeping laxity of Ardent Mage society, the High Inquisitor offers her services to any group who shares her attitude towards slackers.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%UnitProfileRageWizardsHero3Title">Sunseeker Zakiya Eli </LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%UnitProfileRageWizardsHero3Description">It will take the sands of time a thousand years to scrub the name of Sunseeker Eli from the collective memory of the Ardent Mages. A political animal who grew the Al-Rubit branch of the priesthood into a powerful force, she is a skilled coalition builder with an instinctive ability to ferret out the secret weaknesses of all those who cross her path. With an immense pain threshold to boot, and famed for holding the record for the longest walk over broken glass, Sunseeker Eli remained a skilled wizard held in great respect by her people. All these feats pale into insignificance, however, as compared to the night she let a Necrophage swarm annihilate more than five hundred of her clansmen. "A gift to the gods," she called it. "An Appeasement of Agony to pay for our sins of weakness." Banished by the Saoshyant himself, Sunseeker Eli wanders Auriga seeking to lead those she views as deserving.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%UnitProfileRageWizardsHero4Title">Nahla al-Jazar, Argbadh of the Phoenix </LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%UnitProfileRageWizardsHero4Description">Born in the slums of Gnos-Kalath, Nahla was abandoned by her birth parents before her first night was out, left to die on the banks of Black Iron River. If not for the passing of an old crippled beggar, Nahla's story would have ended there -- pecked to death by cranes or snapped up by the fire lizards that lounged in the shallows. Luckily for Nahla, the beggar was no ordinary vagrant but a disgraced and blinded wizard who'd been excommunicated from his order. Nahla grew adept at the wizard's arts, but her mind always turned back to the night of her birth. Why had her mother forsaken her? Shame? Superstition? Simple poverty? The question burned, and when she fought at The Games, the annual tournament beneath Table Mount, this fire propelled her into the realms of the elite competitors. Invited to join the Academy of the Phoenix, Nahla left behind the only father she'd ever known, and went onto become one of the greatest Argbadhs the Ardent Mages have ever known.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%UnitProfileRageWizardsHero5Description">To Wadeha Hakan, glass is the most wondrous of nature's gifts. Strong as steel, beautiful as diamonds, clear as fresh water. To think that a handful of sand, fused in a crucible of fire, can become a goblet of exquisite elegance or a pane of colored light! Or, when honed to a perfect edge, a weapon capable of slicing through a man's throat as though it were simple silk... Wadeha knows these truths only too well, and from humble beginnings has forged a crystal empire with links to the most powerful clansmen in the entire kingdom. With the ear of the highest in the land, even the Saoshyant, Wadeha is a master of economics, diplomacy, and governance.

  <LocalizationPair Name="%UnitProfileRageWizardsHero6Description">Lost in the Arani Deserts after a prolonged sandstorm drove his small Clan far from familiar routes and oases, the Falhala Clan was presumed by the Saoshyant to be dead, scattered, or in open rebellion when they didn't appear at Table Mount for the annual Meeting of the Clans. None of these presumptions could have been further from the truth. Rallying the Falhala Clan in an unprecedented show of strength and unity, Bos√©'s inspirational leadership kept them going even as their numbers dwindled due to dehydration and starvation. A Hero's welcome wasn't awaiting when Bose finally brought them home, however. The Saoshyant, angered by the Clan's long disappearance and still suspicious, stripped Bose of all his titles and wealth and banished him from the nation.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%UnitProfileMadFairiesHero1Title">Tlato Mosi Pakwa</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%UnitProfileMadFairiesHero1Description">A talented hunter trained to track over great distances, Pakwa came from a tribe that had the cheetah as its fetish. He was adept at taking long, circular sweeps around Wild Walkers towns and cities, keeping a careful eye for whatever changes may have occurred. A rarity among the Wild Walkers, Pakwa still occasionally uses his powers of the Sharing to travel as a cheetah. 
This nearly proved his undoing, as once when chased by a starving pack of Lycans he was forced to remain in his feral form for more than 12 hours. Plunging deep into an ancient forest to escape his pursuers, Pakwa found a hiding place in the ruins of an Endless site full of decayed and inactive Dust. His presence caused it to awaken, seep into him, and return him to sanity. When the Lycans arrived minutes later, they came face to face with a warrior-god of the forests who slew half of the hunting pack and sent the rest running home.
Wiser for his experience, Pakwa remains the most gifted hunter of the clan, but uses his abilities as a cheetah only sparingly and when in great need.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%UnitProfileMadFairiesHero2Description">Even within a relatively serious clan, Tocho had a reputation for grimness. It went from bad to worse when his elder brother was killed by a pack of wild yeti; Tocho hunted them one by one and made a crest of their hair for his helmet. His reputation as a cold-hearted and dangerous hunter earned him the nickname "Winter Lion", and his troops are in awe of their demanding and pitiless leader.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%UnitProfileMadFairiesHero3Description">Famed for his ability to fell two marks with a single shot, there are few bowmen who can match Citli's skill as an archer--a skill that saved many of his canopy-siblings lives on the Night of the Moonless Water when a Replicant host attacked the forest city of Twelve Boles. In the aftermath of that victory, still singed with the flames that had licked the woods that night, Citli became a popular figurehead in the Wild Walker ranks.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%UnitProfileMadFairiesHero6Description">As a child, fascinated by the Wild Walker mechanisms of power, Ipsa would often commune with his spiritual animal, the deadly viper, and spy on tribal council meetings. Hidden among the foliage of high branches, Ipsa, in his viper incarnation, would lie motionless for hours, listening to rhetoric, argument, diplomacy--all the tools of the powermonger's trade. He learnt swiftly, putting into practice what he witnessed to strengthen his position among his peers, until he became the ringleader of the village youths. Of course, by undertaking the Sharing before coming-of-age, not to mention using it in such a dishonourable manner, Ipsa was breaking a strict taboo. His wrongdoing came to light when one of the village elders, head tipped fully back after nodding off in a particularly leaden meeting, glimpsed the waxy sheen and unblinking eye of the viper in the rafters, and screamed in fright. Threatened with banishment, Ipsa impressed his elders with his maturity, expression, and passion during his trial, but was still expelled, perhaps on account of his knowledge of his leader's indiscretions. Today he can't help but lead anymore than a fish can't help but swim.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%UnitProfileMadFairiesHero7Description">A merely average hunter, Zaltana was set for a lifetime of mediocrity until age 12 when they discovered that he was a genius with construction. Consumed by a whirlwind passion, Zaltana spent his days delving into everything from the aesthetic details of structure to the mechanical questions of stress and deformation. Frustrated by the Wild Walkers' lack of sophistication, Zaltana left home at age sixteen to seek knowledge. He criss-crossed Auriga, hunting the secrets of the ruins left by architecturally sophisticated  predecessors. Infected by Dust in the depths of an ancient site, Zaltana had a mind-expanding experience and many of the hidden secrets he once sought became known to him. As his insights require tensor mathematics, however, it is difficult for him to share ideas and he is viewed as a somewhat unbalanced eccentric.</LocalizationPair>

Warriors by nature and necessity, the Lycorns have a pivotal role in the defense of the empire. Joslyn, a third son, left to seek his fortune and soon found himself up to his gorget in fame and Necrophage blood. 
Knighted for his acts on the field of Rilldell, he was madea baron by one thankful duke and soon reduced to outlawry by a less friendly one. Now turned mercenary, he is loved as much as he is feared as a leader of troops and winner of battles.
Deyval developed a reputation for battlefield ferocity, attacking with a certain mad glee. He grew to prefer long blades, which are better for keeping the claws and poisons of the Necrophages away from him. Though not in the least a religious man, he is known to recite some sort of phrase or prayer at the end of each successful battle - a mystery whose secret even his closest lieutenants have not unraveled.</LocalizationPair>

Long did Duke Unwin search the icy wastes, but rather than finding answers, Duke Unwin regressed into the kind of debased creature he'd set out hoping to cure. Returning to his birth lands, Duke Unwin was disowned by his family on account of his hungry, feral ways that had served him so well in the north. Filled with self-loathing, he now offers his services to the highest bidder, hoarding coin and still harbouring a desire to mount another expedition to find a cure.</LocalizationPair>

Leofric's world came crashing down in his eighteenth year when, near the conclusion of that year's tourney, his father caught him gallivanting with the daughter of a sworn family enemy. White-hot with rage, Leofric's father frog-marched the boy out onto the field, then made him saddle up and joust with Sir Doran of House Umber, one of the four remaining riders. Sir Doran took the challenge as a great insult, and proceeded to humilate Leofric over seventeen tortuous rounds. A laughing stock, blazing with a shame that dimmed but never went out, Duke Leofric went on from that day forth to become one of the greatest knights to grace the Amber Fields, and now seeks even bigger challenges.</LocalizationPair>

Assembling a party of willing adventurers, for twelve long years the Bishop stalked the subterranean realm seeking the artifact, forging close ties with the Vaulters in the process, while his party slowly dwindled in number. Desolate, the Bishop found his fortunes revived as he became an important advisor to the leader of the large Vaulter settlement, Deepswater.

Drifting through many lands with a tribe of Roving Clansmen, John Port found his facility for overhearing gossip of great use to Auriga's most renowned traders, and rapidly became one of their most trusted servants.

Not for Lord Peyton Quinn though.

  <LocalizationPair Name="%UnitProfileBrokenLordsHero7Description">The story of the Broken Lords has a sad parallel in the story of the de Suluzzo family. Once a prosperous and powerful clan with rich holdings in both town and country, the decline of their physical form led to increased interest in their past, their family, and the "good old days." Commissioning ever more impressive artworks glorifying their past while they wrote and read family histories, in time their number and wealth dwindled as their bodies faded to Dust. Martin, the youngest de Suluzzo -- and perhaps the last -- gained a driving obsession to restore his family and rebuild his nation. The family fascination with the past manifested itself in the exploration of ruins, and one day Martin returned with his servants from a weeks-long journey with a strange artifact in his posession -- and a wild look in his eyes. Since then his energy and charisma have burned like a star, and many see him as a future emperor.</LocalizationPair>

In the case of DD, however, the insatiability was agonizing rather than merely annoying, and drove it to constant foraging or constant battle in order to feed. Driven to eat its own young, that act - forbidden except in times of urgent desperation - made it an outcast from its hive.
After Roving Clan hunters chased it off a cliff and into the sea, DD ended up in a half-submerged grotto filled with broken technology of the Endless. It was there that DD was impregnated by Dust, brought to self-awareness, and reconciled with its rupture from the hive. The creature that emerged to once again travel Auriga was different from the one that fell in; though always hungry and always restless, DD is now able to think, act, and plan rationally without being driven to acts of madness by its hunger.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%UnitProfileNecrophagesHero4Description">The story of Never Rests life is unpleasant, even by Necrophage standards. On the cusp of adulthood, one of Never Rests broodmates succumbed to a ravaging disease. The sickness spread through the nest; first workers, then builders, then soldiers fell sick. Every day-night cycle another two or three of Never Rest's broodmates would show signs of the wasting in shaking limbs, stumbling into walls, forgetting their routine tasks. Despite the evacuation of the cadavers, the infection spread relentlessly. Never Rests fully expected to fall sick any cycle, but there was something inside him that kept the disease at bay. As more and more died, the workload for the remaining Necrophages grew. Never Rests became a leader both inside and outside the nest -- one cycle commanding a fighting party, the next overseeing the disposal of the dying. Finally, inevitably, Never Rests found himself alone, the chambers and tunnels of his nest clogged with the dead. Exhausted and purposeless, he climbed out and lay down on a rocky hillside, awaiting death. Upon waking, strangely, he discovered a ceramic bowl next to him filled with an amber liquid that sparkled in the dying sunlight. The being that left it remains a mystery to this day, but a desperate Never Rests sipped on the liquid anyway and found himself transformed. Wiser, harder, and still tireless, Never Rests struck away from that vast tomb and now seeks adventures elsewhere.</LocalizationPair>

Although his simple mind would not have had any inkling of the changes the consumption of the liquid instilled, Queenslayer found he had a craving for the sweet nectar, and over the course of many day-night cycles, his cognitive function grew fast--and cunning. Slowly, he began to resent his status as a mere servant, then despised it. The weight of the endless days ahead almost caused him to take his own life, before he realized there was a way out. Lobotomizing his queen so that her bodily functions remained intact, Queenslayer became the mastermind at the heart of the nest, fashioning a Necrophage empire of exquisite complexity. Many cycles later, when Queenslayer's matricide was discovered, he fled from the nest, and now offers his services as a governor of rare ability.</LocalizationPair>

Unbeknownst to the party of Necrophages that Strikes Far led, cataclysmic earthquakes deep in the Aurigan interior had altered the planet's magnetic fields, scrambling their pathfinding abilities. Knowing only the way of battle, Strikes Far and his band of vicious fighters carved a path of death across the land, until they came deep into Vaulter territory. With his numbers finally whittled down to only himself, the Vaulters captured and imprisoned Strikes Far, curious to learn the secrets of the Necrophage's  deadly combat. After being force-fed a Dust-enhanced draft, Strikes Far found himself "uplifted" and eventually able to relate his battlefield tactics to his captors. After forging an unlikely friendship with one of their captains, Strikes Far later escaped to become one of the few Necrophages plying the surface of Auriga as a hired sword.</LocalizationPair>

Trained as a scout and hunter in the deep, dark tunnels of Auriga, she won her tattoos fighting Kazanji in the caverns surrounding an extinct volcano. Making the transition to the surface once the Vaulters started foraging and trading outside, she was rapidly promoted after several famous feats of tenacity and endurance.

After his adolescence those hours stretched into days spent scouting, seeking, and wandering. He soon left home and moved from clan to clan, spending years touring the wide spaces of Auriga. He gained many of his trademark features then: a yellow bandanna, eyes that tend to squint as if forever in the wind and sunlight, and a mouth half-lifted in a perpetual grin.
 
Bahas was changed forever by an encounter high on the cold mountains of Drakkenhome, where he was befriended by an equally restless Drakken who showed him some of the treasures of the Endless. Now an eager seeker and explorer of the mysteries of Auriga, his knowledge of the Endless and Dust goes far beyond what his silent and introspective character displays. For this reason he has been made an honorary Bazi (Captain) of the Roving Clans, able to levy and command troops wherever he may be.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%UnitProfileRovingClansHero3Description">Born on the back of a great beast of burden during a fierce thunderstorm, Illegra Mordicant was fated to become a leader of men. Brave and shrewd, she first showed her knack for command when the trade caravan of which she was part became split from its jarkar-guard unit-during a sandstorm in the dangerous Adoban Wastes. After three days of waiting with no sign of help, Mordicant climbed atop the largest pack beast and roused the frightened traders from their hopelessness, instilling in them a deep belief that they could navigate the hostile sands and find refuge. They did indeed, though fully a quarter of them perished and the rest were forever changed. Known behind her back as "Gharqa" -- The Unstoppable Force -- Illegra has a reputation for completing whatever journey, negotiation, or project she sets out on.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%UnitProfileRovingClansHero4Title">Bela "The Bat" Syrav</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%UnitProfileRovingClansHero4Description">Bela learned young the power of information. An orphan, she survived on scraps and hand-outs she received as payment for ferrying messages between the traders of her local souk. She would watch the recipients' faces light with pleasure or darken with worry as they read the notes, and it seemed a kind of magic that marks on a scrap of parchment could have such power. Determined to understand what these messages said, she learned to read, and soon enough was using the scrawled facts for her own gain. Being a child, the traders made the mistake of trusting her unconditionally and she was wily enough to sometimes take the strategic, long-term view with the knowledge she hoarded. Traders doing illicit deals would find themselves dragged away in the middle of the night never to be seen again, while others became ensnared in mutually-dependent relationships that they dared not rock. In time, known only as The Bat, Bela became one of the controlling Dynasty's most trusted sources of information -- a shadowy creature who heard all. Privy to the power politics of the Clans' highest tables, Bela learnt much in the arts of governance, and now offers her services to any race who can pay.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%UnitProfileRovingClansHero5Description">Blessed with a silver tongue, Neqra Zeban was born to a simple family of spice traders. He swiftly grew the family business thanks to his amazing marketplace spiels which left crowds of onlookers spellbound. With an uncanny ability at mimicry, a cutting turn of phrase, and a voracious memory of what passed anybody's lips, he could have the crowd gasping in shock or howling with laughter from one moment to the next. Loved by his customers, Neqra rose quickly through the trading ranks and was on course to become the youngest ever Grandmaster when it all came crashing down. Overheard doing a scandalous imitation of the head of the Gopal Dynasty by no less than the head himself (who was in the bazaar in disguise and allegedly buying powerful aphrodisiacs), Neqra had the misfortune of having few friends in high places. In punishment he had his tongue cut out; mute and full of rage he struck out from the city on his own. Today he communicates via a small chalkboard hung around his neck, but he has lost none of his razor insight and makes a formidable administrator.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%UnitProfileRovingClansHero6Description">In Al Quereshi, known as "The Queen of Caravans" and the shining jewel of the Clans' empire, there is one name that causes more fear in men's hearts than any other: Jasah Murdap, aka The Chained Cleaver. For many years Jasah lived an unassuming life, one of many butchers in the Great Market selling whole poultry, haunches of goat, and tongue and tail of ox to any who would stop at his counter. A genial man with fine wares and honest prices, Jasah's lived happily until the day, unbeknownst to him, he served tainted meat to a visiting dignitary. Embroiled in the political fallout, Jasah ended up accused of involvement in a murder plot, and was sentenced to death by beheading. Jasah's tale did not end there, however. Offered the chance at redemption by the Patrician himself, Jasah life was spared on agreement he become The Last Justice, a permanent fixture of the Great Fighting Pit where condemned men could gain freedom -- by defeating the Last Justice in armed combat. As tall as a steed (and weighing almost as much), still wearing the same bloody apron and still clutching the same giant cleaver, Jasah never knew defeat. On the night he took his five hundredth opponent's life, however, he escaped the Pit, and now is one of Auriga's most terrifying blades for hire.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%UnitProfileDrakkensHero1Description">As with most of its kind, Nachampassesa spent the time of his coming of age roaming Auriga in order to add to the Drakken store of knowledge. While mapping a particularly promising fault crater, Nachampassesa fell through into an ancient bunker of the Endless. In a moment of ecstasy driven by Dust, adrenaline, and euphoria, Nachampassesa gained a deep perception of the uses of Dust. When he returned weeks later to study and archive the contents of the bunker, he discovered that it had been looted by Vaulters. Driven to rage by this act of thievery and vandalism, Nachampassesa tracked and killed the group through a series of tunnels. The experience was formative in more ways than one; he became both claustrophobic and a lifelong enemy of the Vaulter people. To this day he remains wary and mistrustful of the Vaulters and tends to strike before speaking; a level of aggressiveness rare among the pacifist Drakken.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%UnitProfileDrakkensHero2Description">Something of a split-personality of the Drakken city of Nabalis, unbeknownst to his brethren in the Silicate Machinery Library, Jiraduveja spent his off-time haunting the Fighting Pits of the city's Lower Reaches. To begin with he would only watch, his face pressed his face up against the fence, while juvenile Necrophage fought to the death. The spilling of their pungent fluids would wet his tongue, and he would spasm with bloodlust. It wasn't enough. Hooded and cloaked, Jiraduveja eventually entered the pits himself, fighting the creatures with a double-edged weapon known as a saw-cleaver. Maybe it was his passion, but Jiraduveja evolved into a formidable master of combat. When the inevitable happened, and word of his prowess reached his Loremaster, Jiraduveja was thrown out of the Library in disgrace. He didn't care. In fact, he was pleased that he could finally follow his true vocation: Soldier of Fortune.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%UnitProfileDrakkensHero3Description">A brave, fearless Drakken, young Lakaspassar didn't hesitate when she was asked to be part of a small company tasked with the retrieval of important Endless relics believed stolen by Roving Clan traders. Afterwards, flushed with pride at her part in the successful mission (and with adrenaline), Lakaspassar continued to work for the highly clandestine Reclamation Order, swiftly becoming an integral member of their far-ranging raids. On one crusade, however, deep in the dark places of Vaulter territory where the sun is a distant memory and a Drakken feels ill at ease, Lakaspassar's group was fallen upon by a ferocious band of Vaulter soldiers. They were slaughtered save for one; Lakaspassar barely escaped with her life. She blamed herself for her brethren's death and her lack of foresight, vowing one day to avenge their deaths. Whether she does this from inside or outside the Vaulter ranks is up to higher powers; all she knows is that she will be a mercenary until her debt is paid.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%UnitProfileDrakkensHero4Description">A consummate political operator, Loremaster Jayawardene was well on her way to becoming the most important member of the Twelve, the council of elders who govern all Drakken affairs, when a moment of carelessness ended her ambitions. Found guilty of altering a sacred Endless artefact in order to support the position of a Drakken sub-group named the Revitalists, Jayawardene was thrown from the Council of the Eyrie--literally. Tumbling from the tower, Jayawardene opened her wings and soared far from the Drakken's first city, Nahar Tereth, only coming to land when she was many leagues away. Livid with herself, she spent the better part of a year walking Auriga filled with hurt and disappointment, before she recognized the truth of her nature: Her first--and only--calling wasn't love or duty; it was power. And she didn't care where she found it.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%UnitProfileDrakkensHero5Description">An administrator without parallel, Lorekeeper Masargaka brought an engineer's obsessive eye for detail into every facet of his methods of governance. At diplomatic feasts he would personally organise the seating plans, creating complex webs of slights and bonds. When he met emissaries he would greet them in perfect renditions of their tongue, practicing for many hours to get the pronunciation and intonation exactly right. Before signing binding agreements he would alter the wording so there could be no ambiguity, no wriggling out of responsibility. Unbeknownst to nearly all Drakken, his most exacting methods were saved for his investigations into arresting the aging process. Convinced Drakken biology could be altered to dramatically raise longevity, Masargaka oversaw thorough experiments of Drakkenling subjects, hoping to find a way for his race to become true stewards of Auriga through life eternal. When word got out, Masargaka fled, and now seeks to govern elsewhere.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%UnitProfileDrakkensHero6Description">No one would accuse Loremaster Semsanitnwona of not being a duitful Drakken, but he was often considered so obsessive in his devotion to the preservation of Endless knowledge that he was accused of being neglectful of his other tasks. Spending entire days listening at the Whispering Galleries to the voices of days past, Semsa could recount great tracts of Drakken history at loremeets, but would often fail to be up to speed with current events. Determined to learn more of the era of the Drakken's true birth, Semsa battled for long years to be granted a pilgrimage into faraway lands and places, only to be repeatedly refused by The Twelve. At the end of his patience, Semsa left his winged brethren, and now travels Auriga offering to govern anyone in exchange for access to their libraries and vaults.</LocalizationPair>

Namkang, however, was one of a number of eggs that were lost when the Puraksa hatchery wall split open during a violent earthquake; she alone remained viable when the rest perished in the mountain cold. The fledgling was tracked by its piteous cries soon after it hatched, and was quickly returned to the eyrie. Those days alone in the cold and the hours alone after emerging from her shell left a permanent mark on Namkang, however; she is a traveler and a loner among Drakken, exploring even the most forbidding regions as she is indifferent to cold weather.</LocalizationPair>

Now consumed by visions of the End, Andom is often either in existential pain or a state of confusion. In fact, Andom sees not merely the end of the Endless and of the Queen's great plan, but of the universe itself. Whether these visions are the result of mathematical forecasts, emanations of the Queen's mental distress, or simple madness, they are compelling and powerful enough to imbue Andom with enormous charisma.</LocalizationPair>

As a result, Urol now babbles constantly in the tongues of all the peoples of Auriga.

  <LocalizationPair Name="%UnitProfileCultistsHero3Description">Silent and spectral, Edra travels Auriga with head cocked to the side, listening with such intensity that at times it is said that Edra "smells the future". Though there are numerous guesses and rumors about her origin, decades of concentration have reworked her features into a generic image of the Queen herself. As a result, any hypotheses as to the character and capacities of this Hero are meaningless -- as the Queen wills. Every bit as unbalanced as any being that has been visited by the Queen's telepathic mumblings, Edra nevertheless has the uncanny skill of predicting events -- of widely varying importance -- with great accuracy.</LocalizationPair>

Slightly enhanced already due to a long life in a Dust-rich environment, the hero was Chosen by a simple gesture of the Unspoken that could neither be misunderstood nor disobeyed. Tinu disappeared for years, undergoing a sort of education that could only be described as unspeakable torture. For better or worse she was one of the few to survive the ordeal, climbing blinking into the sun from a deep pit beneath the City with no sense of self or of her past. The Unspoken's work on her mind now complete, Tinu is an unquestioning, uncomplaining tool of the Unspoken's will.</LocalizationPair>

Sensitive to Dust due to their time in the ruin, the Unspoken felt this capacity within his brain. With a thought like a lance piercing his body the Unspoken made Exid one of the Chosen -- a great honor that Exid barely survived. Now a living weapon for his master, he lives only to execute tasks in the hope of receiving praise. While the orders that the Chosen receive are inexplicable to rational beings, they do not ask or challenge but merely execute the will of the Cult.</LocalizationPair>

Ozek disappeared from her village that night, and saw only darkness for several decades as she was trained to manipulate Dust. A highly successful experiment for the Unspoken (she survived), Ozek has only recently been released to wander the lands of Auriga. Though she has worked with many nations, one wonders if she remains an unquestioning tool of the Unspoken's unknowable plans.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%ItemBow2MadFairiesMainQuestTitle">Arc of the Builders</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ItemBow2MadFairiesMainQuestDescription">Discovered in ancient ruins by Zaltana and altered to his liking, this deadly weapon is marked to be used as a compass, ruler, scale, protractor, opisometer, stadimeter, tachymeter, and level. </LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ItemTomeBrokenLordsMainQuest1Title">Quivering Circlet</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ItemTomeBrokenLordsMainQuest1Description">Though it fits comfortably around the skull, the constant vibration of this silver circlet and its ethereal lightness indicate an ancient and magical origin. Carefully placed holes indicate it was once part of a larger configuration.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ItemTomeBrokenLordsMainQuest2Title">Pendant of Judgement </LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ItemTomeBrokenLordsMainQuest2Description">More than a mere pendant, this enormous, multi-piece brooch could be a series of detailed etchings -- or  a web of almost infinitely small cogs -- and is certainly but one part of a whole.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ItemInsigniaBrokenLordsMainQuest1Title">Endless Lode Crystal </LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ItemInsigniaBrokenLordsMainQuest1Description">This beautifully shaped block of an unknown material or element, glowing in a deep red-gold color, is more than the crystal it appears to be. Certain markings indicate it was once part of some sort of great object.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ItemRingBrokenLordsMainQuest2Title">Sighing Scepter of Auir</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ItemRingBrokenLordsMainQuest2Description">If you place your ear on this white-blue metal rod you will hear something. Is it echoes of a distant bell, the keening of lost souls, or merely the wind?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ItemInsigniaVaultersMainQuest1Title">Deep Diviner</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ItemInsigniaVaultersMainQuest1Description">The size of a scepter, this gleaming blue cylinder is clearly the work of ancient peoples - or gods - in that it drains the influences of cold and ice from the armies of the empire and imprisons those effects within itself.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ItemTomeNecrophagesMainQuest1Title">Incubation Orb</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ItemTomeNecrophagesMainQuest1Description">Though it lacks a visible source of energy, the orb radiates constant waves of warmth and healing. An artifact left over from the times of the Endless, it has powerful effects on the gestation and birthing of all life forms.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ItemScepter2RageWizardsMainQuest1Title">Transcendent Rod of Verda</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ItemScepter2RageWizardsMainQuest1Description">This ancient scepter, covered with intricate runes and hieroglyphs, was recently modified by skilled hands. A mix of new and old cratfsmanship and materials, its use can only be imagined.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ItemTomeRovingClansMainQuest1Title">Roads of Dust</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ItemTomeRovingClansMainQuest1Description">This ancient manuscript unveils secrets of the Endless, who used Dust magic to reduce both the amount of friction generated by metals and their weight. Industrial goods last longer and require less fuel, and armies can skim faster across the land.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ItemInsigniaDrakkensMainQuest1Title">Spheroid of Drakken Lore</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ItemInsigniaDrakkensMainQuest1Description">This strange orb seems to be a globe of Dust etched with Drakken figures. The closer one looks, however, the more it seems to be made of an infinitely detailed layering of models, texts, and diagrams.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ItemInsigniaCultistsMainQuest1Title">Order of Isiver</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ItemInsigniaCultistsMainQuest1Description">A part of the Unspoken that holds out a hope for peace and harmony, those who have been touched by the Unspoken when this personality was dominant formed a group to advance their particular interpretations of the religion of the Cult. This symbol of their collective will improves the survival chances of troops.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ItemInsigniaCultistsMainQuest2Title">The Wordless Will</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ItemInsigniaCultistsMainQuest2Description">The Queen may make noise, though buried as she is behind layers of protective shielding no one can know. Instead, her desires are known directly through telepathy and dreams, or indirectly through the actions and demands of her servitors. This particular insignia, an extension of her will, meticulously controls all the details of every being in the army's food, equipment, and mental state to maximize their military effectiveness.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ItemHeadStrategic1Tier2SideQuest1Title">Casque of the Wanderer</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ItemHeadStrategic1Tier2SideQuest1Description">It is superstition, of course, that a weapon or piece of armor that sees all the oceans and mountains of Auriga gains superior powers. That would mean that some power is watching over Auriga! Old wives' tales, at best...</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ItemHeadStrategic2Tier2SideQuest1Title">Spikes of Fidaa </LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ItemHeadStrategic2Tier2SideQuest1Description">A strange warrior of an even stranger people, Fidaa was fearless of pain or sacrifice. The helm, which also has spikes on the inside, was said to goad her to acts of unthinkable heroism -- or pain-fueled rage.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ItemTorsoStrategic1Tier2SideQuest1Title">Drakkenvest</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ItemTorsoStrategic1Tier2SideQuest1Description">It is best not to ask if this item was made of dragonskin, or made by dragons. In the one case, they would kill you for wearing it; in the other, people would kill you to get it.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ItemTorsoStrategic2Tier2SideQuest1Title">Hauberk of the Vessel of Life</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ItemTorsoStrategic2Tier2SideQuest1Description">Crafted by Jocelynne Uaiah, a world-famous magesmith of the Sisters of Mercy, this armor is said to console and protect both the body and the spirit.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ItemLegsStrategic1Tier2SideQuest1Title">Knees of the Golem</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ItemLegsStrategic1Tier2SideQuest1Description">Though this armor earned its nickname due to its relative lack of beauty and comfort, it must be said that it still fulfills its role very, very well.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ItemLegsStrategic2Tier2SideQuest1Title">Snowwalker's Striders</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ItemLegsStrategic2Tier2SideQuest1Description">Forged by Vaulter slaves for a Necrophage hero, there were once six pieces to this set. One wonders where the other four may be, as only these two were discovered on the hero's frozen corpse after the Ko-Ek Revolt.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ItemSword2Strategic2Tier4SideQuest1Title">Eayah's Arm</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ItemSword2Strategic2Tier4SideQuest1Description">It is said that Eayah was an ancient hero of the Broken Lords who forged this to his torso to replace a lost arm. Imbued with magic and relentlessly sharp, in this case rumor may be fact‚Ä¶</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ItemSword1Strategic6Tier4SideQuest1Title">Starblade</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ItemSword1Strategic6Tier4SideQuest1Description">Whether luck or an act of the gods, a meteor fell and destroyed a Hurna war party that was threatening a wagon train. This weapon, forged with metal from that stone, also has a reputation for surprising victories.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ItemSword1Strategic4Tier4SideQuest1Title">The Shard of Icarael </LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ItemSword1Strategic4Tier4SideQuest1Description">The metals within the blade and its crafting style are like nothing else on Auriga. The beauty and keenness of the weapon have led many to speculate wildly on its true origin.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ItemBow2Strategic3Tier4SideQuest1Title">Nighthammer</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ItemBow2Strategic3Tier4SideQuest1Description">Long and unusually heavy for a bow, this weapon was crafted for Uaneek Orenda, a Wild Walker ranger who crept out at night to decimate the ranks of besieging Kazanji during the Red River wars.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ItemBow2Strategic4Tier4SideQuest1Title">The Sustainer</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ItemBow2Strategic4Tier4SideQuest1Description">Magic or skill? In either case, this bow kept a Wild Walker clan fed through a long, cold winter; blessed by shaman and dominant in battle it has become famed across Auriga.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ItemCrossbow1Strategic1Tier4SideQuest1Title">Valiant Lightning</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ItemCrossbow1Strategic1Tier4SideQuest1Description">The crossbow was named by a Vaulter Marine after a long running battle with Delvers for control of underground Endless ruins in Utharan. The weapon seems to have been gaining accuracy and power ever since.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ItemCrossbow1Strategic2Tier4SideQuest1Title">The 37</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ItemCrossbow1Strategic2Tier4SideQuest1Description">That is what they appear to be, the tiny numbers etched on the stock of this crossbow. Is it the number of kills? A number in a series? No one knows, and yet, a weapon this powerful should be famous across Auriga‚Ä¶</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ItemShield1Strategic1Tier4SideQuest1Title">Breakwall</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ItemShield1Strategic1Tier4SideQuest1Description">Strangely, this shield earned its name on an offensive maneuver. It was wielded by Lady Fidense Tulak of the Amber Fields when her unmounted charge broke the Necrophage defenses at the Siege of Gleancrag.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ItemShield1Strategic3Tier4SideQuest1Title">Dish of Ka-Nuk </LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ItemShield1Strategic3Tier4SideQuest1Description">A worker in the Col-Druk hive charged with cooking the victory stew after the Siege of Volgy, Ka-Nuk and his shield made an unexpected encounter with an Endless artifact. Ka-Nuk went mad, sadly, but his humble cookpot was transformed into a formidable defensive weapon.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ItemAxe2Strategic5Tier4SideQuest1Title">Stiletto of the Delvers</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ItemAxe2Strategic5Tier4SideQuest1Description">Part description, part joke, this famous axe became known as the "stiletto" when Fest the Hamhand, a Delver hero, succeeded in piercing a Titan's armor with it.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ItemScepter2Strategic3Tier4SideQuest1Title">Junder's Ward</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ItemScepter2Strategic3Tier4SideQuest1Description">Though scepters are typically viewed as ranged weapons, Junder d'Erwan, a Broken Lord healer, was a rather hands-on type of fighter and in his hands this scepter, though blessed with defensive abilities, was even more effective on the attack.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ItemScepter2Strategic4Tier4SideQuest1Title">Vengeance of Ko-Ruk</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ItemScepter2Strategic4Tier4SideQuest1Description">A wounded Necrophage took a piece of battle debris as a makeshift splint. Over time this strut from an Endless ruin melded to its leg, and though the warrior Ko-Ruk died the limb lived on as a deadly weapon.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ItemStaff2Strategic1Tier4SideQuest1Title">Wolfbane the Shepherd </LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ItemStaff2Strategic1Tier4SideQuest1Description">The name of this staff explains its origins. It appears to be covered with tiny nicks, and legend says that one of those marks was cut for every dire wolf head taken by the weapon.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ItemStaff2Strategic6Tier4SideQuest1Title">The Delivering Staff</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ItemStaff2Strategic6Tier4SideQuest1Description">An heirloom of the Ardent Mages' Bayir clan, this flame-blackened staff was used to great effect against waves of hostile Cultists when a combined army of Hurnas and Jotus archers attempted to raze their home city.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestMadFairies-Chapter1Description">It has been a difficult winter. 
 
Not merely the weather and the hunger, but all the rivalries within the Wild Walkers have descended upon the head that wears the crown -- your head. During the long cold months, when both space and activity are lacking, tempers flare and arguments begin. As usual, it is the shamanists of the Sokwa clan who fan the flames. "We should not have left the forests, our gods will desert us, we are made weak without The Sharing..." They should be named the Tateh clan, the Talk-too-much.
 
But you are the onontio, the highest judge and warlord, and for now your word remains law. The challenge is to occupy these grumblers and those who would listen to them; they need a purpose and a distraction. Around you are many ancient sites where previous civilizations rose... and fell. To avoid that same fate, it would perhaps be good to investigate these places -- and give the grumblers something else to whine about.</LocalizationPair>

Your dream of a great new tower to the stars, a symbol to Gaia, has been put off by strikes and riots at the building site. Achak Adahi, who leads the Sokwa, claims your dreams are foolish sacrilege. He, and many others, continue to insist on the old ways. There are those, however, who have seen what you have seen, and question the old ways as you do. 
 
You must explore, go farther, learn more.  You convinced them to look beyond the forests, to seek new ways; it is time to explore farther and find new allies -- or new slaves -- for the cities you see in your visions.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestMadFairies-Chapter2Objective">Your empire must grow, and you must have help to do this. Make contact with a neighboring Minor Faction and assimilate them into your Empire -- peacefully or forcibly.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestMadFairies-Chapter3Title">3. Post and Beam</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestMadFairies-Chapter3Description">There are always those who bluntly refuse to accept reality.
Achak and his followers are twisting their words in philosophical knots, trying to find some explanation for the things the patrols have discovered. The facts are clear: We are not alone, and we were not the first. One day their disagreements could turn violent; Truthseeker Jenoa is not the only one who warns you of this. 
 
From these other peoples you have heard others tales and new histories; many of these myths and legends contain seeds of a similar story -- a story that ends in tragedy. The farther you go, and the further you study, the grimmer and more perplexing the truth becomes. 
 
In one way Achak and the Sokwa are right; your people remain small and weak compared to the vastness of Auriga. Your empire must be secured and your armies developed; no great construction can take place unless your realm is secure. The Sharing, while dangerous, gives you a great advantage when scouting -- it is time to exploit that advantage.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestMadFairies-Chapter3Objective">You have certainly learned this: Auriga is dangerous. Develop your military by selecting a Hero and building a worthy army. Test the Hero and their army in battle and secure peace in your region.</LocalizationPair>

However, you must start by securing your own region. Other peoples must be brought into your empire, and their stories and tales must be added to your knowledge. Survival will go not just to the mightiest armies, but to the wisest leaders.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestMadFairies-Chapter4Description">The truth must be accepted, even when it is unpleasant.
Achak seems to be silent, for the moment. But it is likely that things will flare up when you announce your latest idea: permitting beings of assimilated factions to rise up to high-level posts in your government. If allies can be trusted, why should they not be exploited to the fullest?
 
It is a time of consolidation and reflection, for the knowledge you have gained requires time and analysis before it can be acted upon. But your convictions remain clear on two points. First, that Auriga is a dangerous place that requires buildings of exceptional strength if your people are to survive whatever forces destroyed those who came before you. Second, that the Wild Walkers must be open and inclusive to any and all peoples, ideas, and improvements that can help secure their future. Certainly those who built the ruins had knowledge of engineering far beyond what is known today.
 
Your eyes burn as you read the ancient texts; your ears ring with the debates and arguments of scholars. It has been days since you swung a sword or fired a bow in earnest. But you are onontio, and your people come first.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestMadFairies-Chapter4Objective">Now that the region is safe, you turn your eyes back to the internal workings of your empire. Strength and progress will come by building and improving City Centers and building up Districts.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestMadFairies-Chapter5Title">5. The Cornerstone</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestMadFairies-Chapter5Description">It has been a time of great learnings.
First, you learned that Achak Adahi would rather die than admit his failures. He and a band of shaman attacked the palace, hoping to start a revolt. Your hand has not been on the sword hilt much of late, but you still had the reflexes needed to run him through at the door of the throne room. Those who followed him turned to Lycans and disappeared in the night. 
 
Many fell defending you, and some of those were from the peoples you assimilated. You also learned that you command great loyalty. 
You learned, finally, that rumors of a thing called "zaltana" were in fact stories centered around a person -- Ahote Zaltana. Tales indicate he was once a Wild Walker, and that he has studied the secrets and structures of the ancients for many decades. He has named them the Endless, for he believes that their works will endure until the end of time.
 
Two things are certain: Zaltana would be of enormous value to you, and you have no idea where he is...</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestMadFairies-Chapter5Objective">To bring your vision for the Wild Walkers into fruition, the mysterious Ahote Zaltana must be found. Track him by inspecting an ancient site where he is rumored to be.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestMadFairies-Chapter5-Step1">Look for Ahote Zaltana by searching the ancient site of $QuestPOI1</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestMadFairies-Chapter5Outcome">A legend has stepped out of the forests and into your tower. Now, you must grow and exploit that legend.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestMadFairies-Chapter6Title">6. Methods and Materials</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestMadFairies-Chapter6Description">Half mystic, half scientist, Zaltana is both everything you expected and nothing at all like what you expected. It is fortunate that he communicates with schematics and designs, for when he communicates with words much of it sounds like gibberish.
 
Regardless, the lucidity of his drawings speaks directly to the visions that you have seen - a great base, a soaring tower, a monument to the constructions of the Wild Walkers and a place to weather whatever storms Auriga may bring. But the techniques and materials are beyond what you know, and it is for this reason that Zaltana must first improve his skill, and then find an ancient site where he can apply that ability.
 
Other reasons, reasons that you speak of to no one, have also compelled you to fund and staff Zaltana's expedition. The more you study the ancient texts, the more your sages and searchers plot and analyze the cycles of winter and the occurrences of storms, the more you realize that Auriga seems to be on a downward spiral. You do not know where the spiral may lead, and what the fate of the planet may be. But you are guessing that ruin and devastation will come for those who are not prepared.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestMadFairies-Chapter6Objective">You must improve Zaltana's skills if you hope to stave off the oncoming cataclysm. Once his skills are improved, he must take an expedition to discover the secrets of the Endless.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestMadFairies-Chapter6-Step1">Level Zaltana and give him the skill $SkillToCheckName (Level $SkillLevelToCheckNumber )</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestMadFairies-Chapter6-Step1Tooltip">A Hero levels through battles or by being the governor of a city. Go to the Hero Inspection panel, then the Skills tab, to unlock the desired skill.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestMadFairies-Chapter6-Step2Tooltip">Assign Zaltana to an army and use it to search the highlighted ruins.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestMadFairies-Chapter6Outcome">Whatever Zaltana has discovered only he understands; hopefully you will be able to build it before time runs out.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestMadFairies-Chapter7Title">7. The Keystone</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestMadFairies-Chapter7Description">Zaltana has emerged, holding designs for a thing whose complexity seems impossible. How can hands build something whose plans are incomprehensible?
In his designs you understand some things, and are utterly confused by others. In that gap between the comprehensible and the arcane something whispers to your subconscious; something that speaks of power and emptiness as endless as the universe. That is a worry in dealing with geniuses: Trying to comprehend them may drive you mad.
 
But if your sanity is the price for the survival of the Wild Walkers, it is not too great a price to pay. More than ever you understand that Auriga is changing; the pessimists say she is dying, the optimists say that she evolves. Even the optimists admit, however, that this "evolution" may be inimical to all forms of life.
 
Zaltana must be encouraged, this strange set of thinking tools he has designed must be created -- from Mithrite, of all things! -- in order for his constructions to go ahead. And there is no alternative; the constructions must go ahead.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestMadFairies-Chapter7Objective">Now that the tools -- both magical and human -- are ready, the labor must be done.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestMadFairies-Chapter7-Step1">Assign your Hero Ahote Zaltana to one of your cities and make sure he has the Arc of the Builder equipped on him</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestMadFairies-Chapter7Outcome">Zaltana is a spark, and the resulting fire of energy and creativity is more than you had hoped. But is it enough?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestMadFairies-Chapter8Title">8. To Build a Wonder</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestMadFairies-Chapter8Description">The Wonder has been planned and can now be built; models and descriptions have been erected in a pavilion for public display. The sooner construction begins the better, for all work seems to have slowed down as crowds of people visit the models and try to imagine what it is and how it could possibly come to be.
 
Zaltana is in the midst of it all: Explaining, demonstrating, almost preaching. A handful of others seem to have caught on, as other savants and geniuses begin to understand pieces of what that vision may be. But there is only one Ahote Zaltana, and the future of the Wild Walkers hangs on his abilities. 
 
Those sages and scientists who still study the planet, rather than visit the pavilion, mutter unhappily and do not meet my eyes when I ask what they have discovered. No one likes to bring bad news to their onontio. The unspoken words are clear, however: This thing they refer to as "The Last Winter" is coming, and it is a race between the Wonder and time, between construction and destruction.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestMadFairies-Chapter8Objective">You will have the glory, but only Gaia knows if that will also bring success. Build the Wonder in your Capital City, and hope that it is enough.</LocalizationPair>

The first step is to secure our new home. To found a city, build an army, and explore the ancient places.

For all of those reasons, we must explore and exploit them. With caution, however; any place of great value will be guarded by creatures of great strength. We must not forget this.

Exploration will also take their mind off of our condition -- and this new method for dealing with it. Dust is expensive and difficult to exploit, but this new way, this draining of living souls to sustain our own forms, it goes against who we are. It violates our principles, our honor. It is everything we have been fighting against. 

And yet, it is easy...</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestBrokenLords-Chapter2Title">2. Our Baser Nature</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestBrokenLords-Chapter2Description">The nobles are unhappy. I understand their reasoning; we try to rebuild our nation and survive the changes in our planet, but the exploitation of Dust is slow and expensive. To simply leech life from others is fast, easy, and gives one a feeling of power. It is a heady thrill that gives sensations of virility and perception - almost invincibility.

Marquis Suluzzo is perhaps the worst. Though all the nobles and fanatics seek ancient relics to give them power, the bauble that the marquis has found has given him great strength of persuasion and an enhanced ability to drain life. His speeches make it all seem so easy: Exploit the lesser peoples for our own glory, rule the planet from a position of strength, and turn those who would defy us into weakened slaves.

But I cannot accept this. It is expedient, but that does not make it just or right. Sadly, my hand has been forced and I have little choice but to let the sages and alchemists study, seeking an answer that is pleasing to their greedy patrons. We will forge ahead with research and improve our knowledge -- though I do it for other reasons. For my part I would see our people resist temptation, even if it presents a risk. There is a reason that the first word of the royal seal is "honor".</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestBrokenLords-Chapter3Title">3. Perilous Frontiers</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestBrokenLords-Chapter3Description">The power of the marquis grows daily. There are those who whisper in my ears that I should bring him into my inner circle, even make him the King's Hand; our history is rich with examples of warring factions coming together through unexpected alliances. Those who recommend this conveniently forget that there are just as many stories of realms that were torn apart by unions as ill-considered as this one would be...

While the nobles and populace watch Martin de Ildan de Suluzzo, I will push ahead with my own plans.  Explore, find additional sources of Dust, gain greater control over the nearby regions and peoples -- that is how I see our people surviving. Not by turning into armored leeches. A new city is good, and new Watchtowers will help us to hold it. Perhaps I can find a way to convince my subjects that we can survive and grow without this obscene feeding.
Perhaps when we explore we will find new artifacts like the Quivering Circlet, which now throbs with power that we have restored and now try to understand.Vinchus, the artificer, has also come up with some interesting notions and unexpected ideas. He believes there is a link between the Quivering Circlet and the marquis's pendant; his studies show that both share repetitive patterns of incomprehensible runes and show similar reactions to the presence of light and Dust.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestBrokenLords-Chapter4Title">4. A Kingdom Divided</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestBrokenLords-Chapter4Description">I am trying to take solace in the fact that, at least, the answer has been made clear. The nobles and my subjects have given me an unspoken ultimatum: I remain the king, and place marquis as governor of a great city, or I will be deposed and risk that he takes control of the whole empire.

Growth and prosperity. I remain convinced that if I show these goals are obtainable by honorable and honest means, this obsession with draining life will fade. I am perhaps over-optimistic in regards to the venality of my citizens, but if I do not set an example I fear that we will all become bloodthirsty ghouls wearing the trappings of civilization.

Growth, development, a future full of hope -- these are good messages, but ones that require tenacity and patience. To suck the life from another being, on the other hand, is quick, easy, and pleasurable.

We shall see which one becomes the model for this kingdom. Whatever comes of the appointment of the Marquis as the head of a city, it remains my duty to lead and guide the rest of the empire and prepare it for whatever future awaits us.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestBrokenLords-Chapter5Title">5. A False Redemption</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestBrokenLords-Chapter5Description">Well, that was an entertaining disaster.  Strangely, the golden future that the marquis and his followers promised did not suddenly fall from the clouds. 

His positioned is weakened, and I will take advantage of that. Officially, it will be a diplomatic and military effort that will offer him the chance to redeem his honor.  In fact I send him to pain, if not death, in order to rid myself of him -- and wrest the artifact from his grasp. In manipulating his downfall, one could say that I am no better than he is. But I do this for what I believe is necessity; I cannot see a future for my people on the path he has chosen. Perhaps my honor must be sullied so that the honor of my people remains pure. So be it.

Vinchus has aided me in preparing the ritual to separate the Marquis from his artifact (and perhaps his life). Far from the city, with only a handful of followers, he will be vulnerable and subject to the same forces that he uses to drain others. I find a certain poetic justice in this, though in that sense of contentment at another's distress I also feel shame. Perhaps that is how the Marquis started down his path...</LocalizationPair>

The marquis seems to have vanished from Auriga; he and most of his troops disappeared into one of the great ruins and neither word nor survivors have come out. Strangely his pendant remained, glowing at the entrance. A twisted strip of endless mysteries.

At least the alchemists and archivists are dancing with joy, now that they have his pendant to study. Vinchus states that, beyond any shadow of a doubt, the pendant and the Circlet were once the controls of a great machine. Further study, however, has shown indications of where a missing third piece may be. If the third piece has any resemblance to the powers of the first two, its discovery is of the utmost importance to the empire. Auriga does not release her treasures without a tithing of blood, however. Let us hope the thing will be worth the lives it will cost to obtain it.

Now I can return my efforts to serious matters, as the marquis was an unwanted diversion from the true challenge -- the long-term survival of our people on Auriga.</LocalizationPair>

That is why Vinchus now has both the eternal gratitude of the empire and a stunning domain in Palunbajo. Such efforts should not go unrewarded.

How long had I lain in that darkness? Only the stars know, but my limbs, rusted and groaning, tell me ages must've passed. I will never forget the looks on their faces--haunted, awestruck, but above all, fearful. The realm that they'd called home, the subterranean paths and chambers that riddled the planet, had come under attack from some cataclysmic force, had shaken and split and ruptured, decimating their numbers.
 
Their leader, the First of the Bloodline as she is known, recognised in me something valuable, and brought me back to life in that dusty crypt. For this I will be eternally grateful. I vow to be her faithful servant until the end of days, wherever that may lead.
 
Now they retreat to the surface where they believe they will find respite, where they hope they will find answers.

On my chassis is stencilled my droid class: Operation and Medical Procedures Robot... but I am certain I was known by another name. Whatever it was eludes me though.
 
To save myself from madness, I try not to dwell on these matters, instead focus on the plight of my new masters. The legends of their past are awakening.

I think something broke inside of me...
 
The Vaulters aren't interested in my ramblings. Their attention is on Auriga. The planet shifts and turns, but to what end is unclear. I sense unease among their ranks. Division, even.

All the suffering, all the bloodshed I witnessed must have caused something in my mind to snap. I went on a murderous spree. The instruments used to ease pain became tools I used to inflict pain. Countless men and women died at my hands. Thank the gods, but somehow I was stopped, left for scrap in some abandoned place. But now I learn the worst thing. The Vaulters who saved me are the descendents of those who I murdered. In many of their faces I see the faces of those I cut to ribbons. My shame and guilt burn bright, but I do not have the strength to confess.
 
Instead I will attempt to find redemption. I vow to do everything in my power to aid their quest for survival. Artefacts and relics studied by Vaulter scientists have suggested the existence of the legendary "Argosy"--an near-impregnable fortress their ancestors were driven from after an ancient catastrophe. Many believe it is the key to their survival, that they will be able to ride out the cataclysm within its walls. I believe the "Argosy" is one and the same as the great ark I lived in for so long, and I have told First of the Bloodline Zolya as much. My memory banks still contain some hints to its location, and soon an expedition will be mounted to discover its precise whereabouts...</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestVaulters-Chapter4Objective">Evidence for the lengendary "Argosy", a near-impregnable fortress thought only a myth, has come to light. The site must be found... and entered.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestVaulters-Chapter5Title">5. Gaining Knowledge</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestVaulters-Chapter5Description">Stalking the dimly-lit corridors of the "Argosy" has brought back all the horrors in my mind. I remember odd details--desperate hands gripping a bulkhead, a woman scrabbling to get away into a vent, staring at a bloody scalpel with gleeful fascination. The memories stun me immobile, unable to speak. My behavior has not escaped the notice of First of the Bloodline Zolya. She doesn't ask outright, but as we explore the site together she gives me plenty of chances to talk. I dissemble, afraid to tell her the truth. Our bond is weakening.
 
Not that she doesn't have other things to occupy her mind. A few days after we breached the walls of the place, the evidence has become overwhelming that the "Argosy" is much more than a mere fortress. It is a starship. A starship that crashed ages ago. The ancient legends that speak of the Vaulter's journey under the stars was not quite right. The Vaulter's journey was between the stars. They are a starfaring people! Auriga is not their true home. The revelation has rekindled all the divisions in the Vaulter ranks. Zolya presses on regardless. The "Argosy" must be repaired, its missing parts found. The Vaulter's destiny is back among the stars.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestVaulters-Chapter5Objective">The "Argosy" is much more than a fortress. It is a starship. The long task of repair must begin--part of which is finding the missing parts. The stars await.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestVaulters-Chapter6Title">6. Crisis of Faith</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestVaulters-Chapter6Description">I have told Zolya my dark shame. My mechanical limbs shook as I confessed. For a long while she stayed silent. She told me that this was a hard truth for her to hear, but better that she knew than didn't. She said she'd begun to draw away from me, but with this confession she could begin to have faith in me again. "Will it happen again?" she whispered. I told her I couldn't be certain it would not, but that I thought it unlikely. "You harm a single one of my people, and I will have you broken into a million pieces." After these words she has said nothing more on the subject, and I believe that she keeps my confession to herself. I mustn't let her down. I long to be back among the stars.
 
Not that reaching them will be easy. Already word of the "Argosy"'s existence has filtered back to the Vaulter cities, and many are afraid of what the future will bring. In fact, rebels in one of the Vaulter strongholds claim First of the Bloodline is leading the Vaulters to annihilation and have taken control of the city, crippling the supply of vital resources. Understanding the long dormant and corrupted systems of the "Argosy" is hard enough without such complications, and I grow despondant we will ever leave Auriga.

  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestVaulters-Chapter7Description">The fighting across Auriga intensifies as the many races of the planet battle for survival. Every day more and more Vaulter wounded cross my operating table. They bleed and moan and scream, and long-forgotten feelings stalk the fringes of my mind. I do what I can to share the burden, disseminate what I know to the other Vaulter medics, but they cannot match my abilities. I was built to heal, to mend, so why do I find it so hard? Even though I am a machine, I give myself downtime, but the breaks never feel long enough. Soon it will be time for my next shift, and I am afraid of what might happen, but I cannot neglect my duties. I wish whatever outcome the Vaulters are fated comes to pass soon.
 
My burden hasn't been helped by the infighting, but Zolya has finally quelled the rebellion. Her attention turns back to the "Argosy". Some of the finest Vaulter minds have made great progress understanding the sophisticated systems of the starship, but still new philsophies, new theories, are needed if the "Argosy" is to become spaceworthy. To this end Zolya has decreed that investment in science is to be maximized. Against the backdrop of the planet ripping itself apart from the inside out, and the intense fighting in the borderlands, the Vaulter's newfound unity is an inspiring thing. I just hope it means their survival.</LocalizationPair>

At least I have found the courage to tell Zolya of my growing impulses. Four Vaulter guards are now stationed in my theatre. They think they are there to protect me from attack, when the fact is the opposite is the truth. I can remember the peace of the endless dark, and I simply wish to be among the stars again, free.
 
Necrophage attacks come in increasing waves. The "Argosy" is so close to being ready for launch, that I sometimes give in and imagine the violence of take-off--the rumble of engines, the crush of gee-forces, the scramble of senses. Until we destroy the Necrophage menace once and for all though, there will be no glorious escape. They kill engineers, destroy vital equipment, decimate supplies. It is as if they know that Auriga is doomed, know that they too are doomed, but won't rest easy until all the other races are doomed too. If we are to escape this world it is time for the fiercest fighting and the bravest sacrifices. In Zolya I trust.</LocalizationPair>

The hind-legs calls himself Rhiss al-Khali and tells me he is a "scientist" --one who studies the ways of things. His quest for knowledge has led him far from his birth race, and he has roved the surface of this great land learning much. I led him through the teeming hive, hoping to awe him, even frighten him, but his eyes sparkle with glee. He speaks of strange chymistries, and wishes to study how hind-legs and Necrophage differ. He teases me with ideas of a superior breed, marrying the best of both races. The other captives are more afraid of him than me. I don't trust him, but he may be a great boon to us.

I never imagined a hind-leg could show such chitin, such single-mindedness. Maybe his experiments mark our path to victory. Menials! Fetch the hind-legs!

Every cycle I find myself seeking his company over the seething activity of my narrow-minded broodmates. His mind is as fertile as before, but now there is an edge of the untamed in his ramblings. What he truly wants remains cloaked in darkness, but I am beginning to think he does indeed seek nothing more than pure knowledge.

The noise distracts me from my task! Menials! Get out! Ah, some peace. But a brittle one. Our acts have not gone unseen by the eyes of the hind-legs. They grow bolder by the day, sending out parties of fighters. They will be killed and feasted upon, but I fear for the day they organize themselves as well as we do. They will overwhelm us unless we have the numbers; our attention must turn to a new chamber. While we build it we will be vulnerable. The hive will need to be protected, the enemy scattered from our lands. Then? Then we can truly start swarming this world "Auriga"...

Rhiss has many ideas for how we might forage such a path. His mind is aflame, painting a blazing trail of the contraptions, strategies, and... unions... we might follow. While his mind burns, his body hardens and bends, becoming more like us every cycle. I never speak the thought, but he may be our future, a hybrid of hind-legs and hive-dweller that marries their capacity to reason with our brute strength.

  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestNecrophages-Chapter5Description">What can you learn from a dead enemy? That was the question Ka-Riss asked me. A simple question, but a deep one. Answers skittered in the shadows, out of reach, until I finally understood his meaning. Nothing. Nothing can be learnt from a carcass, from a bag of bones wrapped in rotting flesh. Yes, we might feed, but we don't learn. We learn of the enemy by having one of them fighting by our side, or better, letting one of the enemy lead our own numbers. We wait and watch and learn. But how? I demanded. How do we convince a single hind-legs to join us, to reign death upon his own broodmates? You do not know men, he told me. They will betray their people, their land, even their own family for the right incentives. Money, power, pure simple hatred, he said, eyes gleaming as he looked up. He told me there are places --"marketplaces" -- where the hardiest leaders from different races can be bought, traded, sold. They will lead your armies and you will learn how men think, he said.

My carapace crawled with anticipation, but before he left he told me something profoundly troubling. It might all be for nothing, he said. His "science" tells him winters grow longer; some hind-legs claim it marks the end of days, even the death of Auriga. He scuttled away, leaving me with only the distant tic and hum of the hive. Maybe we must plan for this day, but now the light is dim and I cannot see how. For now we will learn the ways of the hind-legs, absorbing their bravest.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestNecrophages-Chapter5AltDescription">What can you learn from a dead enemy? That was the question Ka-Riss asked me. A simple question, but a deep one. Answers skittered in the shadows, out of reach, until I finally understood his meaning. Nothing. Nothing can be learnt from a carcass, from a bag of bones wrapped in rotting flesh. Yes, we might feed, but we don't learn. We learn of the enemy by having one of them fighting by our side, or better, letting one of the enemy lead our own numbers. We wait and watch and learn. But how? I demanded. How do we convince a single hind-legs to join us, to reign death upon his own broodmates? You do not know men, he told me. They will betray their people, their land, even their own family for the right incentives. Money, power, pure simple hatred, he said, eyes gleaming as he looked up. He told me there are places --"marketplaces" -- where the hardiest leaders from different races can be bought, traded, sold. They will lead your armies and you will learn how men think, he said.

My carapace crawled with anticipation, but before he left he told me something profoundly troubling. It might all be for nothing, he said. His "science" tells him winters grow longer; some hind-legs claim it marks the end of days, eventhe death of Auriga. He scuttled away, leaving me with only the distant tic and hum of the hive. Maybe we must plan for this day, but now the light is dim and I cannot see how. For now we will learn the ways of the hind-legs, absorbing their bravest.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestNecrophages-Chapter6Title">6. Legends of the Endless</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestNecrophages-Chapter6Description">Our plight consumes me. When I rest, instead of the soothing dark that once cloaked me, I am flooded with visions of ruin. Rivers of fire cascading out the depths. Hives crushed into nothingness. Mountains upturned, the land scrubbed of all life, hind-legs and hive-dweller all dead. When Ka-Riss is lucid, a state that escapes him for most of the cycles, he scratches incoherently about a machine --built by the ancients of this planet-- that may be our salvation. He is my most accomplished leader in the field, but his mental regression, his slide into becoming yet another savage killer among thousands, fills me with dread. As my mind soars, his unravels. Maybe civilization will be beyond us. Maybe I am the freak, the monster, an evolutionary dead-end doomed to return to the dust from whence I came.

Whatever awaits us, whatever we will become, we must survive. I have decided I have no choice but to submit to his ramblings, let him lead a swarm to the bones of this "Endless" race. Therein lies an "Incubator", a machine that will grant our unhatched immortality, let them live for countless cycles beyond the reach of flame and ice until the the cataclysm passes. We will swarm over the lands, lay waste to our enemies, plant our eggs in every nook, every crevice that we can find, and in time beyond measure, when the stars have shifted, a new generation will crawl out onto a virgin land. Auriga, our birthright, will forever be ours.</LocalizationPair>

Nothing occupies his mind other than the next fight, the next feed. We are killers. And I? I have found peace with that. We are what we are. And we will survive.

The eggs that we will scatter to the darkest corners of this land will see to that. Before that though, our numbers must swell so that we can send our swarms far and wide. The eggs must be buried in icy chasms, the hearts of forests, desert caves; every habitat we can reach, for none know which places will heal and which will be forever blighted after the winter has passed. By conquest, by gluttony, or simply through the sheer march of time our numbers will swell to meet the task.

As we grow, we must build. A factory chamber that can replicate this Endless "Incubator", this strange machine that will keep our eggs out of time's grasp, must be constructed.

And the cushion plumpers? The soft-bellied priests and commanders who buzz around the Saoshyant like flies around dung--they whisper in his ear that my hand played a part in his death. Thus, I, Zor Abaz had no choice but to flee. What dark magics my brother entwined himself with I do not know, but what I know is that his loyalty to our people, his loyalty to our gods, was beyond reproach. That whatever path he'd set himself upon was one for the glory and protection of our people. I swear, as the stars are my witness, I will find the perpetrator and inflict on them the ultimate penance. And more than this, I will discover my brother's quest: His work will not die!

  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestRageWizards-Chapter2Title">2. Ancient Paths</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestRageWizards-Chapter2Description">The truth is we were growing slovenly. Turning away from the caress of thorn and whip and fire. Turning away from the old gods. Turning away from the very pain that gave our lives meaning--and power. I was disgusted by our failure; my brother, even more so. We didn't see eye to eye on all things, but we saw eye to eye on that. He was . . . searching . . . searching for something that might arrest our fall and restore our convictions. What, I don't know. Whenever I pressed him he would say "Sister, the truth lies in shadow. When it comes into the light I will tell you all." He was taken in the final contrition trying to learn that truth.
 
I have talked with one--a man named Fisilt--who claims knowledge of my brother's death. He tells me that shortly before Verda lost his life, he was often seen travelling an ancient road that joined two ruins - those places where the Dust whispers. Many avoid this land's old places, believing them haunted by long dead spirits. But perhaps my brother had found something important there? The only way to know is to search the ruins.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestRageWizards-Chapter3Description">We possess the finest interrogators in all Auriga.

That my Inquisitors learnt little from the prisoners tells me that there was little to know. Search the ruins, they were told. Safeguard any trinkets you find, and smite any who follow in your path. Who gave them such instructions, and for what ends, remains shrouded in darkness.
 
Pure rage, pure violence isn't always enough. Sometimes the mind can see further than the eye, and now I wonder what other traps my brother‚Äôs enemies - my enemies - have laid. There are many other villages in nearby regions, thus many other potential risks and traitors. We must find them, speak with them, and ensure that no other traps have been laid that may catch us unawares.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestRageWizards-Chapter4Description">Every morning after administering my seven repents, I walk from the castellum to the chamber where my brother‚Äôs scepter hangs, and take it in my hands. The instrument hums with a strange power, as if it is restless, as if it still seeks something. I imagine Verda holding it, spinning it, mastering it. Somehow it holds the key to his demise, holds the key to his work. We will found a new city, populate it with our brightest minds, and raise it as a center of mortification and study as is needed to understand my brother's enquiries. The scepter has an affinity with the Dust that permeates this world, like a diviner's rod channeling ancient forces. I am certain that Dust is key to what my brother sought to achieve, but by what methods remain a mystery . . .
 
A great temple of science must be constructed, and the nature of Dust, and its link with pain, must be explored. Word comes from outside our borders that other races are afoot, jostling for land and power. We must be leery of these races, protect ourselves from their advances in any manner we see fit, but we must not delay in our scientific explorations. The winters grow fiercer, grow longer, and I fear that one year there will come a final judgment. And I believe the means of our salvation will not be found in thicker furs or higher walls or sharper blades, but in something much deeper, something my brother glimpsed in his agonized dreams.</LocalizationPair>

Sometimes it makes a man a savant of numbers, sometimes it makes him able to scale a wall in three bounds, sometimes it makes his heart hammer so hard it erupts from his chest in a crimson fire. I am certain that long ago our forgotten ancestors mastered this Dust, and enslaved it to do their bidding in miraculous ways. We are far from that point, but our path is clear. We have climbed onto the foothills of knowledge and caught a glimpse of boundless lands beyond, but we must keep climbing until Dust contains no more mysteries than does water.
 
But to reach that place, we must know more of the magic of Dust and how it has come to permeate Auriga. We must study the land itself, the anomalies that populate it like gifts from a mad but loving god. And there is something else.

  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestRageWizards-Chapter6Description">Every night he comes to me in my dreams. Always the same. I believe it is a memory--well part of a memory--but the mind plays tricks so I cannot be certain. We are children, a handful of years between us. We are walking in the dunes beyond the last tents of our settlement where penitence is offered, the sun hot, the land barren save for a scattering of spine trees. Something sparkles on the sand, and Verda snatches it up. He turns his back, gasps. "What, what have you found?" I cry, curious but enjoying being teased nonetheless. "Show me!" He turns back to me, his hands cupped, eyes gleeful. "With this we could be as powerful as the Saoshyant, sister." He lifts his hands closer... and then the earth shudders, and the sun blinds me momentarily, and when I can see again he is gone, only his footprints left in the sand.
 
When someone leaves you suddenly, without warning, without answers, it is like having a piece of your heart ripped from you. You are not complete. I know this because though the shock of his death has now passed, there is still a hole the shape of Verda inside of me. I don't know if we will ever be together again, but I do know that that hole--that wound--will only begin to heal when I learn the truth. 
That is why Reza's claim -- that she has found a way to fix the location of my brother's secret hideaway -- leaves the hairs on the back of my neck raised, and the taste of fire on my tongue. Will we learn to tame Dust, and will I gain some peace? I offer extreme mortification, praying that when we find this haven it is much more than a simple retreat...</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestRageWizards-Chapter7Description">The air was musty, and though the flasks and instruments were caked in a layer of grime the echoes of Verda's presence came to me. The way he stacked codexes, the small relics he carried for luck, the faintest trace of his scent in the robes hanging in his armoire. Reza brought me his chronicle, carrying it in a devout fashion, opened to the last entry. The scrawl was his; spidery and precise. The date at the head of the parchment recorded a day a few scant days before his death. I read:

"I have found myself thrust upon a miracle, the ebb and flow of the Dust inside my mortal body like the tide of a wondrous sea. When it comes, it comes in great waves of fire, cleansing me, before infusing me with the strangest powers. Sometimes the pain is so great a blackness takes me, but regardless of what wounds it inflicts upon me I always come back. In two days I will possess more Dust than I will ever need. I will transcend. I only hope Azeema keeps his word."
 
Azeema. I know that name. A Roving Clansman. A Warden from the Icatha Clan, according to Reza. The Clans? Our distant kin with whom we shared the beauty of the plains with so many ages ago? Nothing more than filthy Dust hoarders now, grown fat from their control of the markets. It seems obvious, now -- if anyone had discovered the hidden power of Dust it would be the Clans. Had they suspected the forces Verda was about to unleash? Is that why he died? I shall not wait long for an answer. Outside, the lookouts have spied a column of Dervish and Kassai approaching our position. We will smite this army with the fury of the righteous. Auriga will know--and see--the truth of Dust.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestRovingClans-Chapter1Title">1. A Merchant's Tale</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestRovingClans-Chapter1Description">It has been said, by women and men wiser than myself, that only the gods can know the beginnings and the ends of things, and in claiming to recount a tale one steps upon their all-powerful toes. I dare to say that I have a tale, however, and in the telling of it I hope to offend neither the listener nor the gods, for though there is a beginning, it is you who will see it through until the end.
Blessings, then, on the infinitely wise R√†d√†t, Mistress of Tered and goddess of Numbers, and the quick-witted Tebadel, Master of Words and god of Commerce, and on their families and on their children, and on you, and on yours.
I was born Ahsun ar-Delg√πr in the year of the White Sparrow, called Twenty-third Penitence by the Red Wizards or 1647 ASA by the Metal Lords. The fourth son of a fourth son I knew there would be little of my family's fortune for me, so when I was of an age I set out to make my own, armed only with the wisdom of my Clan and the blazing confidence of a youth who has not yet seen great misfortune. I did in time see it; though I will not trouble you with the tales of those years, of the thousands of yerbat I traveled across this amazing world, of the sights I saw, of the wealth I won and lost and won again. Suffice it to say that in the year of the Silent Dove, known as 1675 by the Metal Lords, I founded this city with a handful of troops, seeking to discover the truths behind certain legends.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestRovingClans-Chapter1Objective">It is best to be undisturbed when seeking truths, particularly when they are not underfoot. First pacify the $MinorFactionName villages in the region with the ruins indicated by the Rays of Dust.</LocalizationPair>

Next we had to divine, and test, and excavate, to understand more of this world and the ways that Dust has enhanced it. For Dust has always been the rhythm and lifeblood of Auriga, as the market is the rhythm and lifeblood of the Clans.

  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestRovingClans-Chapter4Description">It is said that blind greed leads to blind decisions. If I was to be accused of any weakness, it would most likely have been that one. However, regardless of what the rumors whispered, I did not then look to gather Dust solely to increase my own treasury.
Scientists and mystics have always been excited by one curious goal -- bringing together enough Dust to create what they called a "critical mass". It sounds more like a weight problem than a glorious discovery, but they assured me that if sufficient volumes of Dust could be assembled, the magic within it would awaken sufficiently to unlock echoes from the great Dust labyrinths of the past. 
But I must not forget my people in my rush to amass this Dust; it would be wise to increase the prestige and influence of my empire at the same time as I increase its wealth.</LocalizationPair>

The Academy of Teneb stated, without hesitation, that the greatest resonance of Dust from across Auriga lay somewhere beneath our feet. What great labyrinth of the ancients had been built?

  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestRovingClans-Chapter6Description">It is said that before beginning any project one should be well supplied with logic, prayer, and luck. Yet only the first two can be controlled by us and for the third, the gods must intervene. And so it was, for me; in one of the old places of Auriga we discovered an ancient mechanism that we called the Well of Dust. It was a thing of glorious complexity; equal parts motionless and mechanical, energetic and inert, enormous and seemingly simple.
The great question, however, was this: Could its functions be reproduced or rebuilt? For if we were to build this mechanism that filtered Dust from the air and the ground, the fortunes that I could have amassed would go beyond the wildest ravings of our most avaricious sellers. In fact, to rebuild this in the mercantile heart of my empire would give me nothing short of a mercantile miracle...</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestRovingClans-Chapter6Objective">In order to understand and reproduce the Well of Dust, our sciences must be highly advanced and the Trade Routes that bring Dust maximized.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestRovingClans-Chapter7Description">It is said that if willing hands cannot be found, unwilling ones will do. That was the set of my mind at this point in my quest; I refused to be dissuaded or derailed. Perhaps it was indeed Dust Fever; perhaps one day I would be found chattering mad amid ledgers and scrip, seeing thieves and swindlers in every shadow. 
If that was to be my fate, I thought, so be it! At least, first, I would give my people a wonder the likes of which had never been imagined since the days of the ancients. But to build a wonder required effort and time... and labor.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestRovingClans-Chapter8Description">It is said that dreams are dangerous things, for they drive one to fulfill them at any cost. One could argue that this was indeed my fate; I had forsaken my family and given over much of the ruling of the Clans to others while in the pursuit of my goal. But I saw the final stretch laid out before me, waiting like a well-irrigated caravanserai at the end of a long road of dust and desert.
I was prepared to do whatever it would take to reach that terminal step. That, I suppose, is where the ambitions of youth can take you if they are not tempered by wisdom! Though by now my hairs were gray, my beard long, and many rings of gold decorated my scarves and my fingers. Still, I would not stop, nor relinquish my goal.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestRovingClans-Chapter8Objective">To gain the most benefit from Well of Dust, you must build it in a city in the center of your economic empire. The more Dust and Trade Routes it touches, the greater your windfall!</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestDrakkens-Chapter1Description">She extends her wings, stretching her muscles. The gesture has replaced a simple smile, as she learned during the trip that a Drakken smile induces terror, not harmony. 

Kehangana is content. The city has been founded, and this first step of her duty responsibly executed. They are far from Drakkenhome but that, she believes, was the will of the Twelve. 

Had it been her sister, Prapaheni, things would have been different. They would have halted a scant few days from Drakkenhome; Prapaheni would be too concerned with distance from tradition and not enough with movement toward the future. The Twelve were wise to choose Kehangana first. And this is especially true now, with signs of change so heavy in the air. What to make not just of the longer winters and the earthquakes, but also of something closer to home - the birth of those they call Drakkenlings. Why do the eggs that only ever produced Drakken now producing these things? Why now? Many confusing signs seem to appear -- and accelerate. Whatever the answer may be, it is certain that it involves change. And Prapaheni is ill equipped to deal with that.

This first city beyond Drakkenhome will be their hand extended to the other peoples of Auriga. It is a difficult project, and Kehangana fears that it will perhaps too quickly show the strains that lie beneath the surface of their alternating diarchy. Regardless of her own worries, however, she will press on. Not merely because it is the will of the Twelve, but also because it is the best hope for Auriga.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestDrakkens-Chapter2Description">Prapaheni awakens. While the smells of the warren are familiar, the smells from the surroundings are radically different. She is upset, uneasy. She knows they were sent to found a new city and doubtless her sister, Kehangana, interpreted the commands a bit too liberally. It is irresponsible to travel so far from the Twelve, so far from Drakkenhome. Though physical distance is easily conquered with wings, what Prapaheni fears is distance from tradition. Without tradition, without structure, will they not descend into the forms of their most ancient ancestors, before They came, and revert to barbarism?

The first step is to contact other peoples, and bring them the benefits of Drakken wisdom and power. The Drakken must impose their values, by influence or by force, lest the other beings of Auriga stray from the great principles that They once set down: Protection, stewardship, preservation. In a later time they must also think of a Nursery; the new Drakken city will need more of their people, even if they are those alien Drakkenlings, to propogate their message and maintain their customs.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestDrakkens-Chapter3Title">3. Resolutely Forward</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestDrakkens-Chapter3Description">Kehangana awakens, and sees that Prapaheni has not been idle. 

Their prestige and influence grow; sadly, the military grows as well. Prapaheni turns too easily to aggressive methods in order to achieve her goals. Regardless, it is now Kehangana's time, and she will not waste it. 

The passing of Chamewhana into the Whispering Galleries is an inevitable part of the cycle of Auriga; Kehangana refuses to view it as an omen and simply gives reverence to the one who has passed on.

The priority is to a new Nursery; they must study and prepare for a wondrous if unpredictable future among the peoples of Auriga. Kehangana cannot believe that retreating into ancient tradition and hidebound ways will help them face the changes that are coming; it is not in dogma that the Drakken will find flexibility and adaptation. Science, patience, study, diplomacy, growth - these are the ways that the Drakken have always coped with change, and they will certainly serve well in these uncertain times.</LocalizationPair>

The sights and sounds of the Oologic Nursery give some solace in this strange place, but she feels the same gnawing unease as her sister. Doubtless They had many means to listen and study the planet, but the knowledge of these ways disappeared when They warred upon Themselves. 

She is loathe to inspect ruins and desecrate Their remains; the very thought is unpleasant to Prapaheni. Instead, she decides to work methodically through the many minor peoples they have encountered, speaking to their scouts and their wise men to see what information they have gleaned. This is and always will be the role of the Drakken: To protect and guard the lesser peoples, to maintain things as they are in a world of chaotic change.

Why else could They have left the Drakken as stewards of Their home?

Regardless, the artifact must be studied and understood. Assumptions made from cursory glances and uninformed readings must be countered by careful analysis done by the wise and the experienced.

  <LocalizationPair Name="%MainQuestDrakkens-Chapter6Description">Prapaheni's slumber has not been restful. She awakens ill at ease and restless, wondering what news has come of the strange artifact.

Before the archivists and loremasters are even part of the way through their reports she stops them; rewriting history is of no use to the Drakken. The Drakken have a responsibility and a way to execute that responsibility, and cracked theories will not help them. She forbids further study of the object; were it in her power, she would have it destroyed. The mission of the Drakken is not compatible with their sacreligious ideas and she will have nothing to do with them.

No, the way of the Drakken is to grow tall and strong, to lead by example, to impose their will upon the mighty and to preserve and protect the weak. She will not take off on flights of fancy like Kehangana; she will instead show the glory of the Drakken ways.

The artifact in question is merely a gift and a trinket; it will be treated as such.</LocalizationPair>

The loremasters have discovered much during the years she slumbered. The Drakkenlings, for instance, were planned from the beginning; They foresaw a time when war between empires would erupt. Written into the cells of the Drakken were the messages that would trigger the hatching of a footsoldier unit when war became generalized necessity. This much They saw: The future of Auriga would be uncertain, but certainly violent. 

The loremasters also speak of the ancient war when They fought among Themselves. Two camps, apparently, broke apart and brought death upon each other. One used weapons of lightning and fire that struck the body, the other devised weapons that worked on the mind and soul. What monsters, then, were They...? A shaken Kehangana would like to know. 

Work on the artifact has triggered the apparition of a spirit or shadow that traverses Their ruins. Kehangana has no choice but to order the desecration of a holy place if she is to know more...</LocalizationPair>

It was cold and terrifying; it preached and promised -- as all the powerful ones do. But this was different. These Cultists want to convert, invade the old places, and cover the world with their believers. But who is insane enough to dream of ruling a world? This Cult. It told us about a vengeance of centuries, and asked us to join their terrible purpose.

I looked right and left to see my people groveling. Their weakness angered me. I did not bow or grovel. I fought back, and refused. That thing, that metal monster, broke my weapon and broke my legs and threw me into a pit. And then it began speaking to me.</LocalizationPair>

\7801\ Journal of a Disobedient:
I don't need to be told that the final steps are coming. It is in the air -- in the voices that crack, in the hurried movements. But I want no part of this. I had forgotten the horror and the shame of being converted, the ruin of my village, the slavery of my people. I wanted to kill them all, to wield a hammer the size of a mountain and bring down their great citadel with one god-like blow.

But they are wiser than I am. As soon as I let my rage show I saw the members of my village driven up to the front lines of battle. And my great challenge was over. Where is my honor and virtue now? Could I sacrifice them for my pride? Would I rather see them they die quickly in battle, or slowly on a planet turned into a vast slave-hold of the Cult? Directly or indirectly I can't kill them. Their fate is their own to choose, not mine. 

I have donned my armor and taken up my weapon and returned to the front of my troops. They were waiting for me, expecting me. My actions, my will is no longer my own. I cannot imagine defying them. The end is coming, and I will be an instrument of its arrival.</LocalizationPair>

\7801\ Journal of a Disobedient:
How did I get here? Leader of a simple tribe, wanting only peace and prosperity for her people. We were ants in a dance of giants, and would have been crushed and enslaved -- or eaten -- by any other nation. But this Cult, this abomination, this sanctuary, gives us a chance to defy and oppose those great empires that sit astride the world like lions across their fallen prey.

The force of their purpose is like a growing wave. You join it and ride; either to create a glorious future, or to crash in a thousand shards on some alien shore. If you don't join the wave it rides over you, and you are drowned and decimated. 

I have chosen to ride it. The purpose draws to a close. The End for which they have been striving is near. We believe in the visions of the Cult as though our gods meant for my tribe to join them.

Perhaps, in fact, they are our gods.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialGameEndedWinnerFormat">{0} has completed the tutorial.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesIntroduction01">I am many things. </LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesIntroduction02">I have been many things. </LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesIntroduction03">Warm and green, </LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesIntroduction04">cold and gray....</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesIntroduction05">Devastated </LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesIntroduction06">and dying.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesIntroduction07">Now I am alive again, </LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesIntroduction08">but I fear my new children imitate the old ones.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesIntroduction09">Some claim the mountains or the forests, </LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesIntroduction10">or build fortresses on the plains.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesIntroduction11">They begin to mistrust, </LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesIntroduction12">and prepare for war...</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesIntroduction13">Still, I love them as only a mother can.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesIntroduction14">And now I fear for them. </LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesIntroduction15">I feel the winds of change begin to blow...</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesIntroduction16">... And this time it may be an all-out storm.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesIntroduction17">I pray that my children will weather this tempest; ...</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesIntroduction18">... for nothing is immortal, </LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesIntroduction19">and one day </LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesIntroduction20">they may have to survive without me...</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesMadFairies01">It is coming...</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesMadFairies02">I am convinced.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesMadFairies03">Now, I must convince the others.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesMadFairies04">We have seen the longer winters ...</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesMadFairies05">... We have felt the limits of the Sharing.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesMadFairies06">Our planet is changing,</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesMadFairies07">we must change with it.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesMadFairies08">We must leave the forests, start again, explore and reach out.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesMadFairies09">We must find new ways.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesMadFairies10">Adapt. </LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesMadFairies11">Learn.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesMadFairies12">For if not,</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesMadFairies13">we will perish.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesMadFairies14">And that will not happen</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesMadFairies15">while I wear the crown.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesBrokenLords01">We were different, once. We fought, drank, and loved as mortal beings.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesBrokenLords02">But our world changed and we faced a stark choice: Alter our bodies, or perish.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesBrokenLords03">Yet "survival" is not the same as "life". Now we are prisoners of the armor that binds us</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesBrokenLords04">and the Dust that sustains us. We must drain Dust, drain energy, or die...</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesBrokenLords05">Where is our honor now, Lords of the Amber Plains?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesBrokenLords06">And what matters more -- to reclaim our honor, or sustain our bodies?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesNecrophages01">The colony was everything. They were born as one, they fought as one,</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesNecrophages02">and they died as one... ...driven by their hunger.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesNecrophages03">But I hunted for something more... I stole the sentience of an ancient power,</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesNecrophages04">and saw a greater purpose. For we were the first; Auriga is our planet.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesNecrophages05">And I will turn our hunger against those trespassers who would take it from us.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesNecrophages06">One day, we will reign supreme on Auriga. And we will gaze up at the stars, still hungry...</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesVaulters01">Our legend spoke of a great journey beneath the stars.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesVaulters02">Safe in our halls and mines we ignored these old tales.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesVaulters03">But then the Great Quake cracked our halls open</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesVaulters04">revealing ancient secrets and relics. Those unknown relics carried our patterns,</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesVaulters05">our images, hints of a hidden past.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesVaulters06">We took them and fled the destruction seeking a new life on the surface.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesVaulters07">Now the legends and relics of our past show the way to our future.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesVaulters08">The journey will be dangerous, sometimes deadly, but we go forth without fear or ignorance,</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesVaulters09">for "courage" and "knowledge" are the bywords of the Vaulters.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesRageWizards01">They are weak. They are soft.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesRageWizards02">They writhe in supposed discomfort at minor¬†penances </LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesRageWizards03">that the faithful would not even notice.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesRageWizards04">Their sloth will be their undoing; </LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesRageWizards05">without the pain, they cannot touch the power.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesRageWizards06">Use your eyes! </LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesRageWizards07">Or I will remove them in atonement. </LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesRageWizards08">See that Auriga herself writhes in anguish -- as we all should.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesRageWizards09">Join me in contrition and mortification</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesRageWizards10">such as Auriga has never seen.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesRageWizards11">Together we will embrace the agony, and make it our servant.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesRovingClans01">Some hope to control their destiny by building. </LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesRovingClans02">Others through science, or by conquest.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesRovingClans03">Do they not see that only Dust can give them what they want?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesRovingClans04">For it is money and power and magic, </LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesRovingClans05">all intertwined in a single, miraculous substance.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesRovingClans06">It is the essence that binds our civilizations together.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesRovingClans07">Perhaps, as we let them believe, it is¬†our weakness.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesRovingClans08">But I have seen its wonders.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesRovingClans09">It is not our weakness; </LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesRovingClans10">it is rather, how we will rule them all.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesDrakkens01">We have always been here. </LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesDrakkens02">The Whispering Galleries have always held the memories of our people.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesDrakkens03">Then They came, and They lifted us up. </LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesDrakkens04">We learned and grew.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesDrakkens05">But They fought, and They fell. </LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesDrakkens06">Our world was swept by cataclysm, </LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesDrakkens07">and we were left alone.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesDrakkens08">Still, we persevere, protect, and maintain, as we always have.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesDrakkens09">We may lack Their sight and Their knowledge, </LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesDrakkens10">but we can still read the omens.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesDrakkens11">Another cataclysm is coming and it is we, the Drakken, </LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesDrakkens12">who must save the world of Auriga.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesCultists01">The Endless broke us when they broke themselves.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesCultists02">Now we are few,</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesCultists03">and many that remain are often of little use.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesCultists04">Yet our purpose still drives us</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesCultists05">even death cannot be allowed to stop us.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesCultists06">We must find new converts, new servants,</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesCultists07">who will help us fulfill the great oaths we took so long ago.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesCultists08">They will not only be our hands and our eyes,</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesCultists09">they will be the sword and the shield </LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesCultists10">of our armies that will bring the Eternal End.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesCultists11">First upon Auriga,</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesCultists12">and then across the universe.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionGreetings">Greetings. Let us see if our empires can live together in harmony.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionGreetingsAffinityBrokenLords">Hail to your grace! Let us hope that we become honorable acquaintances.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionGreetingsAffinityRageWizards">Good day, fellow sufferer. May the agony make us all stronger.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionGreetingsAffinityRovingClans">Well met! A fine day it is for commerce and conversation. In that order.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionGreetingsAffinityMadFairies">How fare you, fellow traveler upon this world blessed by Gaia?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionGreetingsAffinityNecrophages">Your presence is welcome. May you grow prosperous and fat.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionGreetingsAffinityVaulters">Hello, stranger.  We hope that our dealings will be brief and peaceful.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionGreetingsAffinityDrakkens">Peace be to Auriga, and to you. May our conversations be both civil and frequent.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionGreetingsAffinityCultists">Join us! The world and the universe await the flowering of our purpose.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarToTruceProposed">This #F3EAD8#war#REVERT# is bleeding everyone dry. Shall we sign a #F3EAD8#truce#REVERT# and consider our options?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarToTruceSigned">For the moment we accept your proposal to end this #F3EAD8#war#REVERT# with a #F3EAD8#truce#REVERT# .</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarToTruceRefused">Your offer of a #F3EAD8#truce#REVERT# is not acceptable.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarToTruceDeclarationSigned">This #F3EAD8#war#REVERT# shall stop with a #F3EAD8#truce#REVERT#. Do not complain; the decision has been made.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarToTruceDeclarationAcknowledged">We acknowledge that we have no choice. We end this #F3EAD8#war#REVERT# with a #F3EAD8#truce#REVERT#.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionPeaceToColdWarSigned">A status of #F3EAD8#peace#REVERT# does not match our relations. We return to a status of #F3EAD8#cold war#REVERT#.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionPeaceToColdWarAcknowledged">We understand that you are forcing a status of #F3EAD8#cold war#REVERT# upon us.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAllianceToColdWarSigned">We have very good reasons to leave this #F3EAD8#alliance#REVERT# with you. #F3EAD8#Cold war#REVERT# suits us better.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAllianceToColdWarAcknowledged">Let the cards fall as they will; we go from an #F3EAD8#alliance#REVERT# to #F3EAD8#cold war#REVERT#.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionTruceToWarSigned">Our #F3EAD8#truce#REVERT# is no more. Prepare for #F3EAD8#war#REVERT#!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionTruceToWarAcknowledged">So be it. If this #F3EAD8#truce#REVERT# must give way to #F3EAD8#war#REVERT#, we shall not flinch!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionColdWarToWarSigned">#F3EAD8#Cold war#REVERT# is not enough. The price for your attitude is #F3EAD8#war#REVERT#!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionColdWarToWarAcknowledged">If #F3EAD8#cold war#REVERT# is not enough for you, it is #F3EAD8#war#REVERT# that you will have!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionPeaceToWarSigned">This #F3EAD8#peace#REVERT# treaty is an embarrassment. Prepare for #F3EAD8#war#REVERT#!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionPeaceToWarAcknowledged">If you are so hungry for #F3EAD8#war#REVERT#, prepare to eat your fill!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAllianceToWarSigned">You were poor #F3EAD8#allies#REVERT#; perhaps at least in #F3EAD8#war#REVERT# you will be honorable enemies.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAllianceToWarAcknowledged">We were #F3EAD8#allies#REVERT# until you betrayed us. So be it; we shall settle this in #F3EAD8#war#REVERT#.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionColdWarToPeaceProposed">#F3EAD8#Cold war#REVERT# ill suits our empires. Will you endorse #F3EAD8#peace#REVERT# between us?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionColdWarToPeaceSigned">We accept your #F3EAD8#peace#REVERT# offer.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionColdWarToPeaceRefused">#F3EAD8#Peace#REVERT#? Never! Our decision is made.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAllianceToPeaceProposed">Our #F3EAD8#alliance#REVERT# functions poorly, let us return to simple #F3EAD8#peace#REVERT#.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAllianceToPeaceSigned">You desire to gut our #F3EAD8#alliance#REVERT#? Alas, better #F3EAD8#peace#REVERT# than nothing.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAllianceToPeaceRefused">We cannot agree. There is hope and a future in our #F3EAD8#alliance#REVERT#.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAllianceToPeaceAcknowledged">You desire to gut our #F3EAD8#alliance#REVERT#? Alas, better #F3EAD8#peace#REVERT# than nothing.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionColdWarToPeaceDeclarationSigned">Our status will be changed to #F3EAD8#peace#REVERT#, for very good reasons. Pray accept your fate.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionColdWarToPeaceDeclarationAcknowledged">#F3EAD8#Peace#REVERT# is not what we sought, but if we must accept it we will.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionColdWarToAllianceProposed">Shall we #F3EAD8#ally#REVERT#, to face our common enemies in this treacherous world?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionColdWarToAllianceSigned">We are pleased to enter an #F3EAD8#alliance#REVERT# with you.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionColdWarToAllianceRefused">We do not accept your offer of an #F3EAD8#alliance#REVERT#! Do you take us for fools?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionPeaceToAllianceProposed">Shall we improve our excellent relations to #F3EAD8#allies#REVERT#, and better face our common challenges?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionPeaceToAllianceSigned">We are pleased to accept your offer of an #F3EAD8#alliance#REVERT#.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionPeaceToAllianceRefused">No, thank you. We reject your offer to form an #F3EAD8#alliance#REVERT#.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionColdWarToAllianceDeclarationSigned">It is in your interest to join our #F3EAD8#alliance#REVERT#; pray stop fighting the inevitable.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionColdWarToAllianceDeclarationAcknowledged">To be jerked from #F3EAD8#cold war#REVERT# to an #F3EAD8#alliance#REVERT# is painful on the neck, but we must accept.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionPeaceToAllianceDeclarationSigned">#F3EAD8#Peace#REVERT#is not enough; we have decided to form an #F3EAD8#alliance#REVERT#. You have no choice.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionPeaceToAllianceDeclarationAcknowledged">Your manner of creating allies is curious; we see that we have no choice but to join your #F3EAD8#alliance#REVERT#.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDealProposed">Do you accept the generous terms of this offer?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDealAccepted">Agreed. We find your offer acceptable.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDealSigned">This suits us. We accept your offer.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDealRefused">Impossible! We reject this offer.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclarationSigned">We have decided to implement this new policy.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclarationAcknowledged">You force your decision upon us. We accept it, as we have no choice.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionGratifySigned">You have shown yourself to be a wise and powerful leader.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionGratifyAcknowledged">Your kind words have not gone unnoticed. You have our thanks.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarningSigned">It is only fair that we warn you of your unpleasant attitude.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarningAcknowledged">You merely make your poor taste obvious to all.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionPeacefulFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1">With noble empires such as yours, the future of Auriga is assured!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCommonEnemyFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1">We see that our empires fight the same enemies. That bodes well for our relations.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCommonFriendFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1">We note that our empires share the same friends. Your wisdom is noted.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCommonAllyFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1">Common friends and allies make for a hopeful future. Auriga is in good hands.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCommonFrontierFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1">Your recent expansion is not a problem for us, as long as Auriga is big enough for both of us.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarFatigueFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1">This war has gone on long enough, wouldn't you agree?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionLastWarForgetPositive_Occurrence1">We have had conflicts in the past, but wise leaders must learn to forgive.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAggressionDuringColdWarFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1">This surprise attack can only be seen as a betrayal! We hope this does not happen twice.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionOtherEmpireCitiesTakenFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1">We have captured your city; perhaps now you see that it is in your interest to end this war.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionMyEmpireCitiesTakenFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1">You have taken a city and gotten what you wanted. If you now put aside your lust for conquest, we could end this war.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionMyEmpireLeadMilitaryPowerFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1">[Not used]</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionOtherEmpireLeadMilitaryPowerFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1">We have seen your armies, and find them most impressive!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionMyEmpireLeadScoreFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1">When we see empires like yours, we are quite content with the leadership of ours.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionOtherEmpireLeadScoreFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1">We respect you as a wise leader of a great empire.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionUnitsInMyTerritoryFeedbackPositive_Occurrence1">I notice that you have placed armies on my territory. Are they here on vacation?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionPeacefulFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1">We will all prosper if you continue this peaceful behavior.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCommonEnemyFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1">War brings us together, as we now have a common enemy to fight.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCommonFriendFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1">Common friends indicate that we have common goals and ambitions.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCommonAllyFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1">Our common friend joins the alliance; it is a good day for Auriga.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCommonFrontierFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1">Please note that you are encroaching on sovereign territory. And I am the sovereign.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarFatigueFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1">All this cost, all this blood... We hope you realize what you've done.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionLastWarForgetNeutral_Occurrence1">Our past wars were based on past problems. Perhaps wise leaders would forget, and start afresh?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAggressionDuringColdWarFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1">That was a direct provocation! You should be more careful of your actions.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionOtherEmpireCitiesTakenFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1">Capturing the city was an act of justice, not brutality.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionMyEmpireCitiesTakenFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1">However this conflict ends, we will not forget the citizens of the city you captured.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionMyEmpireLeadMilitaryPowerFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1">We can't imagine what foolishness you are plotting, but we wouldn't recommend a frontal approach.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionOtherEmpireLeadMilitaryPowerFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1">Your army may be powerful, but there is more to war than brute strength.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionMyEmpireLeadScoreFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1">If I were in your shoes, I'd pay a bit more attention to the details of my empire.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionOtherEmpireLeadScoreFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1">It seems that our empires could learn from each other.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionUnitsInMyTerritoryFeedbackNeutral_Occurrence1">We don't know what you're planning, but we do know your troops should leave my territory.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionPeacefulFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1">Your actions are peaceful, but our common history makes trust difficult.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCommonEnemyFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1">You choose your enemies more wisely; your behavior improves. We may yet forgive your past actions...</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCommonFriendFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1">This empire is our friend as well. Perhaps you'll be kinder to them than you were to us!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCommonAllyFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1">Are you trying to seduce my allies? We have our eyes on you‚Ä¶</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCommonFrontierFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1">Haven't you grabbed enough? Must you gobble up Auriga's resources next to our doors?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarFatigueFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1">No matter how long or painful this war, we will not relent!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionLastWarForgetNegative_Occurrence1">Our previous war may have been ages ago, but our memory of it still poisons our relations.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAggressionDuringColdWarFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1">This act of aggression is unforgivable!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionOtherEmpireCitiesTakenFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1">Are you upset by our troops walking into one of your cities? Get used to it.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionMyEmpireCitiesTakenFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1">I hope you are prepared to pay for the conquest of that city in blood and Dust.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionMyEmpireLeadMilitaryPowerFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1">We can't help but wonder why you have chosen a strategy of military weakness and incompetence.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionOtherEmpireLeadMilitaryPowerFeedbackNegative_Occurrence1">You may have the greater power, but we will not grovel before the likes of you.</LocalizationPair>
